    HTML5 Web Storage :   https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp
        With web storage, web applications can store data locally within the user's browser.

        Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, included in every server request. Web storage is more secure, 
        and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance.

        Unlike cookies, the storage limit is far larger (at least 5MB) and information is never transferred to the server.

        Web storage is per origin (per domain and protocol). All pages, from one origin, can store and access the same data.

        window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date
        window.sessionStorage - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)

        Before using web storage, check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage:
        if (typeof(Storage) !== "undefined") {
            // Code for localStorage/sessionStorage.
        } else {
            // Sorry! No Web Storage support..
        }

<!--
    HTML5 Web Workers  :    https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webworkers.asp
        When executing scripts in an HTML page, the page becomes unresponsive until the script is finished.
        A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting 
        the performance of the page. You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., 
        while the web worker runs in the background.

        Before creating a web worker, check whether the user's browser supports it:
        
        if (typeof(Worker) !== "undefined") {
            // Yes! Web worker support!
            // Some code.....
        } else {
            // Sorry! No Web Worker support..
        }

<!--
    HTML5 Server-Sent Events :
        A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets updates from a server.
        This was also possible before, but the web page would have to ask if any updates were available. 
        With server-sent events, the updates come automatically.

<!--
    Media :
        <video> : you can manipulate the video with javascript      https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_video_js_prop
                The controls attribute adds video controls, like play, pause, and volume.
                It is a good idea to always include width and height attributes. If height and width are not set, the page might flicker while the video loads.
                <source> : allows you to specify alternative video files which the browser may choose from. The browser will use the first recognized format.
                The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.

        <track> : adds subtitles to a video      https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_track.asp

    Embed a youtube Video or playlist :
        1 - use iframe and define width and height

    HTML Forms :
        <form action="/action_page.php" target="_blank" method='get'>
        
        autocomplete : specifies whether a form or input field should have autocomplete on or off.
                    It is possible to have autocomplete "on" for the form, and "off" for specific input fields

        novalidate : novalidate specifies that the form data should not be validated when submitted.            
        
        autofocus : specifies that the input field should automatically get focus when the page loads.

        form     : specifies one or more forms an <input> element belongs to.
                To refer to more than one form, use a space-separated list of form ids.
                An input field located outside the HTML form (but still a part of the form): https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_input_form
        
        formaction : specifies the URL of a file that will process the input control when the form is submitted.
                    overrides the action attribute of the <form> element


        formenctype : specifies how the form data should be encoded when submitted (only for forms with method="post").
                    overrides the enctype attribute of the <form> element.
                    https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_input_formenctype


        formmethod : defines the HTTP method for sending form-data to the action URL.
                    overrides the method attribute of the <form> element.
                    
        
        formnovalidate : overrides the novalidate attribute of the <form> element.
                        can be used with type="submit".

        
        list           : refers to a <datalist> element that contains pre-defined options for an <input> element.
                        https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_datalist


        multiple    : specifies that the user is allowed to enter more than one value in the <input> element.
                    works with the following input types: email, and file.

        
        pattern     : specifies a regular expression that the <input> element's value is checked against.
                    Use the global title attribute to describe the pattern to help the user.


        GET :
            url ex : /action_page.php?firstname=Mickey&lastname=Mouse
            Notes on GET:
            Appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs
            The length of a URL is limited (about 3000 characters)
            Never use GET to send sensitive data! (will be visible in the URL)
            Useful for form submissions where a user want to bookmark the result
            GET is better for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
        


        POST :
            Notes on POST:
            POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
            Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked

    HTML Layout Techniques. There are four different ways :
            HTML tables (not recommended)
            CSS float property
            CSS flexbox                 (it is not supported in Internet Explorer 10 and earlier versions).
            CSS framework (bootstrap)

    Css Flexbo : a new layout mode in CSS3.
                Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when 
                the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and 
                different display devices. Disadvantages: Does not work in IE10 and earlier.

    HTML Layout (Semantic) Elements :  https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_layout.asp
        these are block-level elements:

        <header>    - Defines a header for a document or a section
        <nav>       - Defines a container for navigation links
        <section>   - Defines a section in a document
        <article>   - Defines an independent self-contained article
        <aside>      Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
        <footer>    - Defines a footer for a document or a section
        <details>   - Defines additional details
        <summary>   - Defines a heading for the <details> element

        
        <section>   : (can be nested with article element) A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading.
                    A home page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information.

        <article>   : (can be nested with section element) specifies independent, self-contained content.
                    An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to read it independently from the rest of the web site.
                    can be used: (Forum post, Blog post, Newspaper Article)
        
        <header>    : specifies a header for a document or section. https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml5_header
                    should be used as a container for introductory content.
                    You can have several <header> elements in one document.
                    
        
        <footer>    : A footer typically contains the author of the document, copyright information, links to terms of use, contact information, etc.


        <nav>       : defines a set of navigation links.

        
        <aside>     : defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).


        <figure> and <figcaption> : In HTML5, an image and a caption can be grouped together in a <figure> element.

-->

<!--
    ComputerCode :
        <code>  - defines a fragment of computer code, does not preserve extra whitespace and line-breaks.
                To fix this, you can put the <code> element inside a <pre> element
        
        <var>   - defines a variable. 
                ex : <var>E</var> = <var>mc</var><sup>2</sup>.

        <kbd>   - element represents user input, like keyboard input or voice commands.
                pressing <kbd>Ctrl + S</kbd>

<!--
    URL Encoding : 
        URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. If a URL contains characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted.
        URL encoding converts non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.
        URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a "%" followed by hexadecimal digits.

    Responsive:
        The HTML <picture> element allows you to define different images for different browser window sizes.

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        This will set the viewport of your page, which will give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.
        
        Responsive Text Size: The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width".
        Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm.

        Media Queries:
        In addition to resize text and images, it is also common to use media queries in responsive web pages.
